Description
Company : We are a leading Internet company operating in Nigeria, currently based in Abuja. We serve multiple estates classified into tiers (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on characteristics like rent prices, demographics, and market potential. Beyond fiber internet, we have expanded into fintech, product delivery, money transfer, and mailing systems.

Gig Overview : We are building a comprehensive Market Intelligence Database Management System that will serve as our central hub for estate analysis, customer insights, competitive intelligence and investment decision making. This system needs to provide deep market insights for any estate or area we are considering for expansion or investment.

This gig establishes the foundational database schema that will power our market intelligence, customer segmentation, competitive analysis, and business expansion strategies.
