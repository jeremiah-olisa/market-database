# Market Database Query System

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive query system for the Market Intelligence Database Management System. The system provides deep market insights for estate analysis, customer insights, competitive intelligence, and investment decision-making.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 3 Complete - Core Query System
The core query system is fully implemented and working with the foundational database schema as specified in req-2.txt.

   - `getCustomerSatisfactionMetrics()` - Satisfaction metrics by estate
   - `getCustomerLifestyleAnalysis()` - Lifestyle analysis by classification
   - `getCrossServiceAdoption()` - Cross-service adoption analysis
   - `getCustomerDemographicAnalysis()` - Demographic analysis by classification

4. **`infrastructureQueries.js`** ðŸ”„ **PLANNED** - Network infrastructure and capacity
   - `getNetworkInfrastructureCoverage()` - Infrastructure coverage by area
   - `getCapacityMetricsAnalysis()` - Capacity metrics analysis
   - `getInfrastructureInvestmentROI()` - Investment ROI analysis
   - `getMaintenanceScheduleAnalysis()` - Maintenance schedule analysis

5. **`financialQueries.js`** ðŸ”„ **PLANNED** - Investment tracking and financial performance
   - `getInvestmentPlansAnalysis()` - Investment plans analysis
   - `getCapitalExpenditureAnalysis()` - Capital expenditure analysis
   - `getROITrackingAnalysis()` - ROI tracking analysis
   - `getInvestmentPerformanceMetrics()` - Performance metrics
   - `getFinancialPerformanceByArea()` - Financial performance by area

## Current System Status

### Database Connection âœ…
- PostgreSQL connection successful
- Core schema tables accessible
- Data seeding completed

### Core Data Available âœ…
- **37 estates** across **12 areas**
- **4 products** (MDU, Internet, Business, Smart Home)
- **Estate classifications**: Luxury (7), Middle-income (6), Low-income (24)
- **Estate types**: Bungalow, Duplex, Block of flats
- **Price trends**: 168 data points across areas and unit types
- **Estate units**: Comprehensive unit analysis with pricing

### Query Performance âœ…
- All core queries executing successfully
- Proper indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Efficient aggregations and calculations
- Real-time data access

## Usage Examples

### Using Working Core Modules
```javascript
import { estateQueries } from './queries/estateQueries.js';

// Get estate occupancy analysis
const occupancyData = await estateQueries.getEstateOccupancyAnalysis();

// Get vacancy rate analysis
const vacancyData = await estateQueries.getVacancyRateAnalysis();
```

### Using Working Single Function Runners
```javascript
import { runProductQueries } from './queries/productQueries.js';

// Run all product queries
const productData = await runProductQueries();
```

### Using the Query Orchestrator
```javascript
import queryOrchestrator from './queries/index.js';

// Get a specific module
const estateModule = queryOrchestrator.getModule('estates');

// Run all queries
await queryOrchestrator.runAllQueries();

// Get system overview
const overview = await queryOrchestrator.getSystemOverview();
```

## Query Categories (Current Implementation)

### Estate & Geographic Intelligence âœ…
- Estate occupancy analysis by area and classification
- Estate classification distribution (luxury, middle-income, low-income)
- Vacancy rate analysis by area
- Estate performance metrics by classification
- Estate type performance analysis

### Market & Operational Intelligence âœ…
- Product overview and performance analysis
- Area overview with estate distribution
- Estate unit analysis and pricing
- Price trend analysis by area and unit type
- Comprehensive market overview
- Business expansion opportunities
- Operational intelligence summary

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy âœ…
- Compound indexes on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key relationship indexes
- Proper use of CASE statements for conditional counting
- Efficient JOIN strategies

### Query Optimization âœ…
- Use of window functions for complex aggregations
- Proper grouping and ordering
- Efficient aggregations with ROUND functions
- Optimized data retrieval patterns

## Data Relationships (Current Schema)

The query system leverages the following key relationships:
- **Estates** â†’ **Areas** (geographic hierarchy) âœ…
- **Estates** â†’ **Products** (service offerings) âœ…
- **Estates** â†’ **Estate Units** (unit management) âœ…
- **Price Trends** â†’ **Areas** (geographic pricing) âœ…
- **Price Trends** â†’ **Products** (product pricing) âœ…

## Future Extensibility

The modular architecture allows for easy extension:
- âœ… **Core system working** - Foundation complete
- ðŸ”„ **Extended intelligence** - Ready for future tables
- ðŸ”„ **Real-time data** - Framework prepared
- ðŸ”„ **External integrations** - Architecture supports
- ðŸ”„ **Advanced analytics** - Query patterns established

## Error Handling

All query methods include proper error handling:
- âœ… Database connection validation
- âœ… Query execution error catching
- âœ… Graceful degradation for missing data
- âœ… Comprehensive error logging and reporting

## Next Steps
