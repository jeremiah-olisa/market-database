## 🤔 What is This Project?

This is a **Market Database Management System** that helps analyze:
- **Real Estate Markets** (estates, areas, units, pricing)
- **Customer Intelligence** (demographics, behavior, feedback)
- **Business Intelligence** (market share, competition, opportunities)
- **Infrastructure Analysis** (network capacity, investments)
- **Financial Analytics** (revenue, investments, market opportunities)

Think of it as a comprehensive database that helps businesses understand their market and make data-driven decisions.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

### Required Software:
1. **Node.js** (version 18+) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **PostgreSQL** (version 14+) - [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
3. **pnpm** (package manager) - Install with: `npm install -g pnpm`

### Verify Installation:
```bash
# Check if everything is installed
node --version          # Should show v18+ 
npm --version           # Should show 9+
pnpm --version          # Should show 8+
psql --version          # Should show 14+
```

### Database Setup:
1. **Start PostgreSQL** (usually starts automatically after installation)
2. **Create a database:**
   ```bash
   # Open PostgreSQL command line
   psql -U postgres
   
   # Create database (in psql prompt)
   CREATE DATABASE market_db;
   
   # Exit psql
   \q
   ```

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

If you just want to see it work:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Set up environment variables (create .env file)
echo "DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=market_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password" > .env

# 3. Run migrations (create all tables)
pnpm run migrate

# 4. Add sample data
pnpm run seed

# 5. Start the application
pnpm start

# 6. Run tests to verify everything works
pnpm test
```

**🎉 That's it!** If all commands succeed, your database is ready and working.

- **`migrations/migrate.js`** - Creates all database tables
- **`seeders/seed.js`** - Adds sample data to tables
- **`index.js`** - Runs queries and shows results

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd market-database

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

**What this does:** Downloads all required packages (PostgreSQL driver, testing tools, etc.)

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
echo DB_HOST=localhost> .env
echo DB_PORT=5432>> .env  
echo DB_NAME=market_db>> .env
echo DB_USER=postgres>> .env
echo DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password>> .env

# OR create manually with notepad
notepad .env
```

**⚠️ Important:** Replace `your_actual_password` with your PostgreSQL password!

### Step 3: Create Database Tables

```bash
pnpm run migrate
```

**What this does:** 
- Connects to your PostgreSQL database
- Creates 20+ tables for all market data
- Sets up relationships between tables
- Creates indexes for fast queries
- Sets up views for analytics

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Found 20 migration files to run
📝 Running migration: 20250725101000-create-products.sql
✅ Completed: 20250725101000-create-products.sql
📝 Running migration: 20250725102000-create-areas.sql
✅ Completed: 20250725102000-create-areas.sql
... (continues for all migrations)
🎉 All migrations completed successfully!
```

### Step 4: Add Sample Data

```bash
pnpm run seed
```

**What this does:**
- Adds realistic sample data to all tables
- Creates sample estates, areas, customers, etc.
- Populates analytics tables with example data

**Expected Output:**
```
🌱 Starting database seeding...
✅ Products seeded successfully
✅ Areas seeded successfully  
✅ Estates seeded successfully
... (continues for all seeders)
🎉 All data seeded successfully!
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works

```bash
pnpm start
```

**What this does:**
- Runs queries against all your data
- Shows sample results from each table
- Demonstrates analytics capabilities

**Expected Output:** You'll see data from all tables displayed in a organized format.

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Run All Tests:
```bash
pnpm test
```

### Run Specific Test Types:

```bash
# Test database constraints and data integrity
pnpm run test:constraints

# Test query performance and indexes  
pnpm run test:performance

# Test individual components
pnpm run test:unit

# Test how components work together
pnpm run test:integration
```

## 🔍 Exploring Your Data

Once everything is set up, you can explore the data:

### Using PostgreSQL Command Line:
```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U postgres -d market_db

# See all tables
\dt

# See sample data
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM estates WHERE tier_classification = 'luxury';
SELECT * FROM market_intelligence_summary;

# Exit
\q
```

### Using the Application:
```bash
# Run the main application to see all data
pnpm start
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
# Windows: Check Services or Task Manager
# Mac/Linux: sudo service postgresql status

# Test connection manually
psql -U postgres -d market_db -c "SELECT 1;"
```

#### 2. "Migration failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if database exists
psql -U postgres -c "SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname = 'market_db';"

# If not found, create it:
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE market_db;"

# Then run migration again
pnpm run migrate
```

#### 3. "Permission denied" 
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure your .env file has correct password
# Try connecting manually first:
psql -U postgres -d market_db

# If that works, check .env file format
```

#### 4. "Tests failing"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure migration and seeding completed successfully
pnpm run migrate
pnpm run seed

# Run tests one category at a time to isolate issues
pnpm run test:unit
pnpm run test:integration
```

#### 5. "pnpm command not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm

# OR use npm instead
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run seed
npm start
npm test
```

### Getting Help:

1. **Check the logs** - Most commands show detailed error messages
2. **Verify prerequisites** - Make sure Node.js and PostgreSQL are properly installed
3. **Check environment variables** - Ensure .env file has correct database credentials
