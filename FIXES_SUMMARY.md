# Market Database - Issues Fixed & Validation Summary

## 🛠️ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Invalid Foreign Key Constraints**
**Problem**: Multiple invalid foreign key constraints that would cause migration failures.

**Fixed**:
- ❌ `service_providers.coverage_area` (GEOMETRY) → `areas.name` (VARCHAR) - **Invalid data type mismatch**
- ✅ **Removed**: Spatial relationships handled via PostGIS spatial queries instead

- ❌ `local_businesses.business_category` → Field doesn't exist
- ✅ **Fixed**: `local_businesses.category_id` → `business_categories.id`

- ❌ `business_metadata.estate_id` → Field doesn't exist  
- ✅ **Fixed**: `business_metadata.business_id` → `local_businesses.id`

- ❌ Customer tables referencing `estate_id` instead of `customer_id`
- ✅ **Fixed**: 
  - `usage_patterns.customer_id` → `customer_profiles.id`
  - `customer_feedback.customer_id` → `customer_profiles.id`
  - `cross_service_adoption.customer_id` → `customer_profiles.id`

- ❌ `capacity_metrics.estate_id` → Should reference infrastructure
- ✅ **Fixed**: `capacity_metrics.infrastructure_id` → `network_infrastructure.id`

### 2. **Invalid Unique Constraints**
**Problem**: Column names didn't match actual table schemas.

**Fixed**:
- ❌ `business_categories.category_name` → Field doesn't exist
- ✅ **Fixed**: `business_categories.name`

- ❌ `local_businesses.business_name` → Field doesn't exist  
- ✅ **Fixed**: `local_businesses.name`

### 3. **PostgreSQL Authentication Setup**
**Problem**: Password authentication failures preventing database access.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Created `.pgpass` file for passwordless connections
- ✅ Set proper environment variables for database connection
- ✅ Configured PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions
